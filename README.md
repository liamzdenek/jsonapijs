Jsonapi JS
==========

This is a complete implementation of the jsonapi.org spec. I am missing some optional features, such as relationship aliasing and hiding.

This is very-beta software and is prone to change. I wrote a lot of this before I learned ES6, and it's pretty embarassing. Volenti non fit injuria
